# Chicksgold Design Challenge

This was a design challenge I performed as a technical test, as a part of my application process for Chicksgold.com. I was handed a PDF file that I had to replicate using vanilla CSS.

Most of the project is just vanilla CSS, I only used Angular to help me with the structure of the document and for the easy access to the icons from Material Icons.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.5.

## Structure

This project features only two components, a Home component and an App component. Most of the code written for this project can be found in these two components and in the `styles.css` file, located in the root directory.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
